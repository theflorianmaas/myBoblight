# myBoblight
Arduino sketch to drive a WS2812B LEDs strip with Boblight and static colors.

It uses the FASTLED and IRemote libraries.

You can toggle (enable/disable) Boblight by a Sony Bravia Remote Control, set a static color or a color pattern.

Need a IR receiver like a TSOP31283 to enable this feature
